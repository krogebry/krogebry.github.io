  <li>If it can't be automated, it shouldn't exist.</li>
  <li>What we deploy today will be replaced tomorrow by what we were building yesterday</li>

These are the things that I aim to hit.  These are just aims, we're not always on target, in fact, in most cases we don't even come close.
The journey of devops and even SRE is not to actually hit these targets, but to work toward a world in which we can aim higher and get as close as we can.
